# Time Series Forecasting: Gold Prices Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Time Series Forecasting** using historical **gold price data**. It applies various statistical and machine learning models to analyze trends, visualize patterns, and predict future prices. 

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains **monthly gold prices** from **1950 to 2020**. The data is preprocessed, visualized, and analyzed using Python.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Statsmodels** – Time series forecasting models
- **Scikit-learn** – Linear regression for trend analysis

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations**: Line plots, box plots, monthly and yearly trend analysis.
- **Resampling**: Aggregating data into yearly, quarterly, and decade-level averages.
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Understanding trends and patterns.

## 📈 Forecasting Models
1. **Linear Regression** – Fitting a trend line on time series data.
2. **Naïve Forecasting** – Using the last known value as the future prediction.
3. **Exponential Smoothing** – Advanced forecasting with additive trend & seasonality.

## 🎯 Model Performance
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)** is used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of different models.
- **Confidence Intervals** are generated for better interpretation of predictions.

## 📌 Key Results
- The **Exponential Smoothing Model** provides better predictions with lower error.
- Gold prices show **seasonal and long-term upward trends**.
- Different forecasting models yield varying accuracy levels.
